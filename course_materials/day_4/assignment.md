1. Create a new column `pop_density` by applying a function that divides
    `pop` by `area`. First create an area column by dividing `pop` column by 10.
    
2. Categorize countries into high and low GDP per capita using a custom
    function.  Use the meadian to decide what is high and low.
    
3 Calculate the minimum, maximum, and median for the `pop` (population) column.

4. Standardize the `pop` column using a transformation.

5. Create a column for the exponential transformation of `lifeExp`.

6. Group by year and calculate the total population.

7. Find the maximum life expectancy for each continent.

8. Pivot the DataFrame to show the average life expectancy for each continent across years.

9. Create a pivot table to calculate the mean and standard deviation of GDP per capita for each continent.

10. Melt the pivoted DataFrame to transform it back to its original long format.

11. Customize the id_vars and value_vars parameters to select different columns for melting.

12. Resample the data to 5-year intervals and calculate the sum of the population.

13. Resample life expectancy data to every 2 years and calculate the mean.

14. Calculate a 3-year rolling average of GDP per capita.

15. Compute the expanding mean of life expectancy.


16. Apply an exponential weighted mean to the `pop` column with a different span.
