# \# 02/01/2024

## \## Attendees

-   James, Sile, JooYoung, and Perry

## \## What to Cover in Summer?

-   Basic data science with Python (pandas for data manipulation; seaborn for data visualization; maidr py binder for multimodal data representation)

-   With Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

## \## Course Period?

-   Ideally in August 2024 for two weeks.

-   Four-day online course a week (two and a half hours each)

## \## How to Teach?

-   Use command-line interface (CLI), Python repl, and basic text editor (e.g., Notepad) in the beginning until participants get used to how to run Python script on their system.

-   Introduce VSCode once participants build a basic understanding of Python repl workflows.

## \## Resources

-   Python Lesson plans at 2024 Coding Symposium: [[https://tech.aph.org/python-lessons/]{.underline}](https://tech.aph.org/python-lessons/)

-   Blind Information Technology Specialists (BITS) at ACB: [[https://bits-acb.org/drupal77/]{.underline}](https://bits-acb.org/drupal77/)

-   Nonvisual Data Science Workshops Series: [[https://iota-school.github.io/nonvisual_data_science_workshops/]{.underline}](https://iota-school.github.io/nonvisual_data_science_workshops/)

## \## To Do List

\- \[x\] Ken: Give James a ballpark estimate of his wage for this summer camp project.

\- \[ \] All: Read through Python lessons at APH and tell Ken what we can recycle in our summer camp.

## \## Meeting Summary

Sonification library: Chart-to-music

Creaters: Julian, Sean, both involved in SAS Ed Summers is now at Github, Microsoft.

MIT visualization group

project: Faculty member is Arvin.

Olli library on Github.

Student, jonathan.

Steep learning curve.

IN DS, Five procedures:

Importing

Tidying

Visualization

Modeling

Communication

Day 1: Loops and conditions - guessing number game.

Day 2: Wordle

Strings, Lists, dictionaries.

Day 3:

Revisit guessing game:

Expand:

Classes,

Flip coin, dice roll, high-low.

Day 4:

Consolidation.

Homework over the weekend.

Week 2:

File handling.

Importing and exporting libraries.

CSV, Excel, etc.

Loading data.

Tuesday:

Playing with Data

Rolling dice?

Visualization

Bar plots?

Hystogram?

Look at rolling dice over time.

Goal: To understand the difference between bar plots, Hystograms and Line plot Box plot

Note:

Go-dice - bluetooth.

Can read them in python.

Wednesday:

Data exploration

Visualization continued

Sonification

Summarization: Mean, standard deviation

Data communication:

Comparison?

Thursday:

Final presentations and questions.

Curated dataset:

Tell us five things about the one you pick

\*\*\*

22nd February.

Mute participants

Encourage listening without implementing code.

Go back through recording at your own pace and implement as you go.

Send questions to class list.

Lots of volunteers to support the class.

Distributing handouts in advance.

Don\'t try stuff before class.

Doing everything through GIT.

Discussion with Ken

Don\'t have to start from scratch

Should test into the class (Ken looking for examples) VS code?

Note: Regardless of platform, you need to be able to do three things (to be specified) in VS code.

Specify what you have to do:

Open and close files in VS code.

Command line,

Ken:

30 mins:

10 questions

30 Mins:

10 of questions

30 mins:

10 mins of questions.

Structure: again!

Introducing a test, to be submitted by the Monday before the start of class.

Action items:

In the next week:

Decide on starting point - test or not

Also: Test, prerequisits like VScode, Python installed, etc.

Decide on goals for each week

Decide on datasets scaffholding

Basic sonification

Then Maidr, even without braille

Note: Could add braille as a post-course session.

Learn python in 43 mins

Note: has a cheet sheet as well.

Ken Perry to Everyone 2:00 PM

Ken going to send a few test exercises

# \# 02/29/2024

Discussion of approach for course.

Pandas

Py datasets:

Use Palmar Penguins dataset.

gap-minder - different counteries, populations, etc.

Diamonds dataset - cut, quality, price, categories.

Python version 3.10 and above.

Create requirements.txt

Data summarization and cleaning.

Visualization - but not the main point

Visualization: seaborn?

Sonification: Medir.

How to save plots to share.

How to manipulate data for different kinds of displays and/or sonifications.

Come up with 10 lessons.

Ken: Names of people who might be interesting to talk to.

Indentation:

Sound Schema for JAWS

NVDA audio support.

We will teach medir for web views and sonification.

Four the course outline:

How about a five sentence outline for each of 10 lessons:

1\) Topic

2\) Objective

3\) Resources (datasets, Pandas functions etc.)

4\) Learning Outcome

5\) Notes

Then lets come up with the set of requirements for participation:

Computer/OS

Access to the web

Level of experience

Pre-test?

Note: Ken, JooYoung and Sile will use GIT for corriculum development.

\*\*Note: JooYoung is away on March 7th, so we will work through Github independently
